            THE IRISH PIG
 'TWAS AN EVENING IN NOVEMBER,
 AS I VERY WELL REMEMBER
 I WAS STROLLING DOWN THE STREET IN DRUNKEN PRIDE,
 BUT MY KNEES WERE ALL A'FLUTTER
 SO I LANDED IN THE GUTTER,
 AND A PIG CAME UP AND LAY DOWN BY MY SIDE.

 YES, I LAY THERE IN THE GUTTER
 THINKING THOUGHTS I COULD NOT UTTER
 WHEN A COLLEEN PASSING BY DID SOFTLY SAY,
 'YE CAN TELL A MAN THAT BOOZES
 BY THE COMPANY THAT HE CHOOSES.' -
 AT THAT, THE PIG GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY!
