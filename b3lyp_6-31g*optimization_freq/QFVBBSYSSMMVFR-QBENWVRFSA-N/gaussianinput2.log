 ADAM SMITH SAID, "THE REAL PRICE OF ANYTHING IS THE TOIL AND TROUBLE
 OF ACQUIRING IT."  BUT IN ALL UNDERTAKINGS WITH NATURE WE SHOULD FIRST
 READ CAREFULLY THE SMALL PRINT IN THE CONTRACT. THIS MIGHT DISCLOSE
 THAT THE REAL PRICE IS TO BE PAID BY THOSE WHO INHERIT THE DEPLETION
 AND DESPOILATION THAT FOLLOWS.
